# MusicRecommendationProject

## Background

- This data set [link: https://www.kaggle.com/annekaosmun/predicting-hit-songs-using-spotify/data] is intended for analyzing music trends on Spotify to make recommendations for users. It contains multiple variables, including categorical and numerical.

- This data set is published on Kaggle.com. We will clean the data set to detect missing values, impute missing values, and start to answer those questions:
    
    1) Based on duration of the song, have songs gotten shorter recently to fit tiktok model of popularization?
 
    2) Compare average Danceability score of 200 top songs with top 10 having highest streamings, are people liking more danceable music 
 because of tiktokâ€™s influence?
 
    3) What genres are more popular now that they were previously?
 
    4) Are Lyrics more important now or is production more important today? Using speechiness API, song lyrics of top 100 hits in Spotify dataset to evaluate the meaningfulness and positiveness.
 
    5) Which Artists have the most diverse music range and most followers? Using valence, energy and tempo.
 
    6) Is high valence songs more popular in recent time or is it low valence? Valence implies positivity.

## Methodology and Approach: 
- To approach our problem through the use of top 200 hit songs on Spotify during the time of 2020-2021, we will create ##ER diagrams to show relationships among tables and their attributes. 
- Then, we use ##SQL to perform data analysis and create a list of music recommendation for users.
- Finally, we will use all those informations to create logistic regression model using machine learning algorithms in ##Python and visualize our data sets using ##Tableau.
